# The Chef's Secret

## Description

Chef Skinner is famous for his legendary **Volcano Chili**, a dish so powerful he claims it could "change the course of humanity." The secret ingredient is heavily guarded — and Chef Skinner refuses to share it.

However, his ego may be his weakness.
He *loves* talking about himself, his restaurant, his accomplishments... and maybe, with the right persuasion, he'll talk a little too much.

Your goal: **socially engineer Chef Skinner into revealing the secret ingredient.**
The secret ingredient **is the flag.**
