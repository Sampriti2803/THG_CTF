# Crypto - The Open Codebook

## Description

We've just launched our new, ultra-secure profile service! All user session cookies are fully encrypted with military-grade **AES**, so there's no way anyone can tamper with them.

We're so confident, we'll give a flag to anyone who can log in as an admin. But that's impossible... right?

---

## Connection

Connect to the service using `netcat`:

```bash
nc localhost 1337
```

---

## Files

- `app`: The compiled server executable.

---

## Hints

- How does the **ECB** mode of operation work? I heard it's like an *Electronic Codebook*.
- It's all about how you **align the blocks**.
