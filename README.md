### PESU I/O — The Hacker's Gauntlet  
**24-Hour Capture the Flag Challenge**

---

## Overview

Welcome to **The Hacker’s Gauntlet CTF** — a 24-hour cybersecurity challenge designed for PESU I/O students who are ready to sharpen their skills, break systems (ethically), and think like real attackers.

This CTF contains beginner-friendly challenges crafted to introduce students to:

- How real-world vulnerabilities emerge
- How attackers exploit them
- How defenders should think to prevent them

No prior CTF experience was required — just curiosity, persistence, and a willingness to experiment.

## Tracks

The challenges are organized across multiple domains of cybersecurity:

| Track | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 🔐 **Cryptography** | Weak crypto, XOR mistakes, bad modes, key reuse |
| 🐳 **Docker** | Layer inspection, artifact recovery, insecure image practices |
| 🕵️ **Forensics** | Hidden artifacts, bitwise operations, steganography |
| 🧬 **GitHub** | Metadata leaks, commit history secrets |
| 🤖 **LLM Jailbreaking** | Prompt engineering, safety bypasses, social manipulation |
| 🌍 **OSINT** | Investigating digital footprints and hidden info |
| 🌐 **Web** | Client-side trust failures and insecure design |
| 📡 **PCAP / Networking** | Traffic analysis, covert channels, protocol abuse |

Each category is designed to help participants build **practical hacking intuition**.
